# Product Requirements Document: Performance Location Scheduling Automation

## 1. Project Overview
An automated system designed to schedule performance locations on animalagos.com for artists in Lagos, Portugal. The system must handle multiple locations across all days of the month within a critical 2-minute window at midnight GMT/Lisbon time at the end of each month.

## 2. Business Requirements
### 2.1 Core Objectives
- Automate the monthly scheduling process for performance locations
- Ensure successful scheduling during the brief availability window
- Handle multiple locations with different time slots
- Maintain scheduling priority order
- Maximize successful bookings within the time constraint

### 2.2 Success Criteria
- All high-priority locations are scheduled successfully
- System completes scheduling within the 2-minute window
- Accurate handling of different time slots for different locations
- Reliable execution at month-end midnight
- Proper error handling and reporting

## 3. Technical Specifications
### 3.1 Timing Requirements
- Execution Time: Midnight GMT/Lisbon (00:00)
- Execution Day: Last day of each month
- Window Duration: 2 minutes
- Time Zone Handling: All operations in GMT/Lisbon

### 3.2 Location Handling
- Support for multiple locations
- Priority-based scheduling sequence
- Location-specific time slot management
- Daily scheduling for entire upcoming month

### 3.3 Authentication
- Secure credential storage
- Pre-authentication before scheduling window
- Session maintenance during operation

### 3.4 Error Handling
#### Retry Logic:
1. Individual Location Failure:
   - Immediate retry once
   - Skip to next location if retry fails
   - Log failure for review

2. System-Level Failures:
   - Website Unavailable: Continuous retry until window opens
   - Login Failure: Maximum 3 retry attempts
   - Early/Late Window: Adapt and execute when available

## 4. Technical Architecture
### 4.1 Core Components
1. Scheduler Service
   - Time synchronization
   - Window detection
   - Scheduling execution

2. Location Manager
   - Priority queue implementation
   - Time slot management
   - Location data storage

3. Authentication Handler
   - Credential management
   - Session handling
   - Login automation

4. Monitoring System
   - Real-time execution logging
   - Error tracking
   - Success rate monitoring

### 4.2 Data Structures
```typescript
interface Location {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  priority: number;
  timeSlot: {
    start: string;
    end: string;
  };
  retryCount: number;
}

interface SchedulingConfig {
  locations: Location[];
  maxRetries: number;
  timeoutThreshold: number;
  monthYear: string;
}
```

## 5. Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Core Setup (Week 1-2)
- Authentication system
- Basic scheduling functionality
- Location data management

### Phase 2: Scheduling Logic (Week 2-3)
- Priority-based scheduling
- Time slot management
- Basic error handling

### Phase 3: Reliability Features (Week 3-4)
- Retry mechanism
- Logging system
- Monitoring dashboard

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Week 4-5)
- Load testing
- Timing accuracy verification
- Error scenario testing

## 6. Monitoring and Maintenance
### 6.1 Key Metrics
- Scheduling success rate
- Average scheduling time per location
- Error frequency and types
- System uptime and reliability

### 6.2 Alerts
- Scheduling failures
- Authentication issues
- Window timing mismatches
- System performance degradation

## 7. Risk Mitigation
1. **Time Window Risk**
   - Pre-authentication 5 minutes before window
   - Optimized scheduling sequence
   - Performance monitoring

2. **Technical Risks**
   - Network latency handling
   - Session management
   - Concurrent user competition

3. **Data Risks**
   - Location priority verification
   - Time slot validation
   - Scheduling conflict detection

## 8. Future Enhancements
1. GUI for location management
2. Real-time scheduling status dashboard
3. Advanced analytics and reporting
4. API integration capabilities
